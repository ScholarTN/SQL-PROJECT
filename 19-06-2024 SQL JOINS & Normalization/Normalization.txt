                                -- NORMALIZATION OF CUSTOMERS TABLE --


Customers
----------
CustomerID
CustomerName
CustomerAddress
CustomerCity
CustomerState
CustomerZipCode
CustomerPhoneNumber
CustomerAlternatePhoneNumber


-- This table violates the First Normal Form (1NF) because it includes multiple values in a single 
    -- attribute (CustomerPhoneNumber and CustomerAlternatePhoneNumber).

-- To normalize this table to the First Normal Form (1NF), we need to separate the multiple values 
   -- into separate columns:


Customers
----------
CustomerID
CustomerName
AddressID (Foreign Key to Address table)
PhoneID (Foreign Key to Phone table)



Address
--------
AddressID
Street
City
State
ZipCode



Phone
------
PhoneID
PhoneNumber
PhoneType (Primary, Alternate, etc.)



-- Now, the "Customers" table is in the First Normal Form (1NF).

-- To normalize further to the Second Normal Form (2NF), we need to ensure that all non-key attributes 
     -- are fully dependent on the primary key. In this case, the "Customers" table is already in 2NF.


-- To achieve the Third Normal Form (3NF), we need to ensure that there are no transitive dependencies 
    -- between non-key attributes. In this case, the "Address" table has a transitive dependency on the
        -- "Customers" table through the "AddressID" foreign key.
     
-- To remove this transitive dependency, we can create a separate table for storing city and state information:



Customers
----------
CustomerID
CustomerName
AddressID (Foreign Key to Address table)
PhoneID (Foreign Key to Phone table)




Address
--------
AddressID
Street
CityStateID (Foreign Key to CityState table)
ZipCode



CityState                                        
----------
CityStateID
City
State



Phone
------
PhoneID
PhoneNumber
PhoneType (Primary, Alternate, etc.)


-- Now, the database schema is in the Third Normal Form (3NF), as there are no transitive dependencies 
    -- between non-key attributes.
